This package is in very early stages. 


Where to start?
===============

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements,
enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

Bug reports and enhancement requests
====================================

Bug reports are an important part of making *xcape* more stable. Having a complete bug
report will allow others to reproduce the bug and provide insight into fixing. See
`this stackoverflow article <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>`_ for tips on
writing a good bug report.

Trying the bug-producing code out on the *master* branch is often a worthwhile exercise
to confirm the bug still exists. It is also worth searching existing bug reports and
pull requests to see if the issue has already been reported and/or fixed.

Bug reports should:

#. Include a short, self-contained Python snippet reproducing the problem.
   You can format the code nicely by using `GitHub Flavored Markdown
   <http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/>`_::

#. Explain why the current behavior is wrong/not desired and what you expect instead.

The issue will then show up to the *xcape* community and be open to comments/ideas
from others.
